# Rasperry Pi NAS project

## Config 1 : PoE 

This utilizes using a PoE adapter and an nvme base with a single nvme. This doesn't have any raid config. Some of the data can be backed up to cloud periodically but the backup size would be limited to a maximum 15 GB, which means most of the photos cannot be backed up.
This solution cannot be upgraded to config 2.

### Partlist
- Raspberry Pi
- NVMe SSD
- nvme base

Total cost for Config 1: $82 + $72 + $14.3 + $30 = $198.3
## config 2: nvme base Duo

Raid config can be used. This is the safest option to store data

### Partlist
- Active Cooler
- Raspberry Pi
- 2 x NVMe SSD
- nvme base duo


Total cost for Config 2: $82 + $144 + $30 + $5.2 = $261.2
## config 3: ext Hdd

This doesn't use PoE. This is the cheapest config. Speed could still be optimized by using an ethernet jack for the raspberry pi. It is not required to buy an external hdd. Some of the data can be backed up to cloud periodically but the backup size would be limited to a maximum 15 GB, which means most of the photos cannot be backed up.
This solution can be extended down the line to use nvme base Duo (config 2) when the item is in stock.

### Partlist
- Raspberry Pi
- Active Cooler

Total cost for Config 3: $82 + $5.2 = $87.2

## Part details

### NVME base Duo

NVMe Base Duo is a PCIe Gen 2 extension board for Raspberry Pi 5. Simply populate it with one or two M-key NVMe SSDs (2230 to 2280 sizes supported) and mount it under (or over) your Pi for a compact and fast storage solution - It even comes with rubber feet!

NOTE: You cannot boot from NVMe drives installed on NVMe Base Duo.
NOTE: This is out of stock

cost: 30 usd
