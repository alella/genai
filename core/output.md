# Answer

Here are the modified descriptions for each config:

## Config 1: PoE 

This configuration utilizes a PoE (Power over Ethernet) adapter and a single NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSD. It does not have a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) configuration. Periodic backups to the cloud are possible, but the backup size is limited to a maximum of 15 GB, which means most photos cannot be backed up. This solution cannot be upgraded to Config 2.

## Config 2: NVMe Base Duo

This configuration supports a RAID setup, making it the safest option for data storage. It includes two NVMe SSDs and an NVMe Base Duo board.

## Config 3: Ext HDD

This configuration does not use PoE and is the cheapest option. The speed can be optimized by using an Ethernet jack for the Raspberry Pi. An external hard drive is not required, but some data can be backed up to the cloud periodically, with a maximum backup size of 15 GB. This solution can be extended to use the NVMe Base Duo (Config 2) in the future, when the item is in stock.

## Part Details

### NVMe Base Duo
The NVMe Base Duo is a PCIe Gen 2 extension board for the Raspberry Pi 5. It allows you to install one or two M-key NVMe SSDs (2230 to 2280 sizes supported) and mount them under or over your Raspberry Pi for a compact and fast storage solution. Note that you cannot boot from NVMe drives installed on the NVMe Base Duo, and this product is currently out of stock.

### Raspberry Pi 5
The Raspberry Pi 5 features a 64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 processor running at 2.4GHz, coupled with up to 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM. This delivers a 2-3x increase in CPU performance compared to the Raspberry Pi 4, along with a substantial uplift in graphics performance from an 800MHz VideoCore VII GPU.

This power can be particularly noticeable when working on the desktop, playing games, compiling your kernel, or running machine learning models.

Key features:
- 2.4GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 CPU
- VideoCore VII GPU with support for OpenGL ES 3.1 and Vulkan 1.2
- Dual 4Kp60 HDMI output with HDR and HEVC decoder
- LPDDR4X-4267 SDRAM (4GB and 8GB options)
- Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0/BLE
- microSD card slot with high-speed SDR104 mode
- PCIe 2.0 x1 interface for
