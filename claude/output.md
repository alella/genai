- `2024-02-17 10:58` - This week I haven't been following all the items in the routine. I definitely am NOT setting up my clothes for the workout next day but I am filling up water every day and I've been consistent with brushing my teeth every day as I've always been. I do forget to moisturize my lips but I am charging my phone regularly when I sleep and I am also keeping it away from my bed so that I don't start doom scrolling on

eck my weight. I‚Äôm at 176 lb right now. That‚Äôs my all-time high.

I want to keep writing because the alternative is to start working and I don‚Äôt want to do that. I want a long break from work.

There is a high-priority issue going around at work. Logged in quickly‚Ä¶ made a few contributions and then logged out. It‚Äôs only 8:00 a.m. I am going to stay away from work for this hour.

Okay‚Ä¶ now what?

I keep staring at this page. I have an hour, right? I have a list of routines on my digital journal. Let me see if I can reproduce some of these routines. The glue that holds all the routines together is the weekly journaling routine. The trigger for this routine is ‚Äúwhenever I have a long period to journal‚Äù. I often will forget this so I have it scheduled. Typically I do this after my workout on Saturday or Sunday morning.

I need to write down what is in a routine. Usually it is ‚ÄúA list of things that I need to do for this routine‚Äù, ‚Äúcomplete #todo-write areas of my notes‚Äù, ‚Äúupdate my fitness stats‚Äù, ‚Äúreview and reflect on how my routines are going on‚Äù. What problems I am trying to solve and what tweaks do I need to make t

e is planning to immigrate to Canada. And that gives me some hope that Amazon will take care of my immigration status. As long as I am making significant contributions to the team, there is no chance that I will run into any issues. It also looks like most likely I am going to lead the Dune team in the upcoming months, which gives me further confidence that my job is not going to get jeopardized. 
- `2024-01-27 15:09` - I also have some monthly goals set up for January and I've hit two of them. I've hit the goals related to journaling as well as exercise. The only thing that's remaining is getting the Pomodoro count up with the office tag. My target this month is 220 and I'm at 93 right now. So that gives me about 27 more Pomodoro's to do and today is the 27th which gives me I think two more days to hit the goal which I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to do it.
- `2024-01-27 18:27` - Friday nights are game nights. Yesterday I played radlands the board game with Pravalli. On the new coffee table. I lost üôÉ.

rgy and getting slightly distracted. I need to re-channel my attention to just one thing.

It's 1:25 p.m. I'm tired of this meeting. I've been in meetings since 10:00 a.m. without a lunch break. My meetings end at 2:30 p.m. I did six work pomodoros today. I want to keep pushing through. I want to hit 11 pomodoros and log off from work.

It's 3:30 p.m. I'm back from lunch 7 pomodoros down 4 to go.

It's 5:20 p.m. I dropped off my wife at the bus stop, and now I'm back. Ten down, one more to go!

It's 6:27 p.m. My goal was to complete 11 work pomodoros, but I did 12!! After having a shower, now I want to clean my room. I'll be back in 10 minutes.

DONE‚Ä¶ I'm free at last! I'm free until 8:00 p.m. today, but then I have pickup duty at 8:00. I also need to fill the gas in my car before I leave.

Okay, what can I do now? I wanted to be free the whole day. Now I am‚Ä¶ what now?

I'm listening to pleasant instrumental music. I'm enjoying writing with my new fountain pen. The act of writing is very pleasant. I truly like doing this. I find it relaxing. Currently, I am noticing that the flow of ink is slightly heavier

- I want to review my journals. - review been written into the journal
  - review recent #habit and #routine tags.

 to put that in the journal and relive the experience. So I reduced the effort slightly and pushed through it.

Today is a Friday!! Hurray!! Fridays feel better than the weekend because you get to anticipate about the weekend.

I don't exactly feel any resistance towards work today. I am in a good mood. It might be the endorphins. I also have only two meetings for the day so I can get plenty of work done. In case I hit a sluggish mood, I can use that downtime to ride to the office to badge in.

It's 3.50 pm. I got 5 Pomodoros down and 3 office meetings done. I'll do 3 more Pomodoros and call it a day.

It's 6.50 pm. I did a total of 7 work pomodoros today. I am done. I saw some more videos of fountain pen inks and cartridges on YouTube. I decided that I was spending too much time on YouTube and turned it off.

I may have the whole evening to write. I might go to Costco to get groceries. I'm not sure though. My wife is busy with her assignments so it's going to depend on her availability.

I am not exactly having a great writing experience right now

y goals from the mid of the month. These are my March goals and their current status.

| Tag/Type | current | target  | progress | time left |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| reflect  | 21      | 15      | ‚≠ê        | 17 days   |
| office   | 91      | 210     | 43%      | 17 days   |
| reading  | 13      | 20      | 65%      | 17 days   |
| exercise | 275 min | 600 min | 45%      | 17 days   |

I already hit one of the goal with the tag "reflect" that's for journaling. I have been spending a lot of time on it. I want to do 210 office pomodoros of which I've done only 91. The progress is only 43% at mid month, which means that it I am slightly falling behind on it. I'm on track for reading. This could be both fiction as well as non-fiction. And the last goal I have is exercise. I want to do 600 minutes of exercise this month. This is my go-to number, although I am falling behind slightly. I'm more confident that I will hit my goal. Overall, I am pretty happy with the stats this month. I need to do better at office. I spend a lot of time with office work, but I t

So this doesn't just mean naps and this doesn't validate napping in the classroom which, I confess I did a little more than I should have when I was in high school but, it does validate the use of naps.

![Neuroplasticity also occurs during NSDR](/imgs/huberman4.png)

But I'll also talk about other protocols that you can use in the classroom that don't involve students sleeping necessarily. Turns out that post-training meditation of a particular kind can also promote motor memory consolidation. I'll just show you these data this is a little bit of a busy slide but the point is this a morning training done at about 8 a.m followed some hours later by a 30-minute meditation of the so-called **yoga nidra** sort which involves just lying there passively. There are no down dogs or up dogs or any kind of active process, just listening to a script I'll point you to some of these references in a few minutes. And then later testing of that material showed a dramatic and and significant reduction in reaction times for this motor task. That's a good thing as well, as speed and consolidation of learning of other sorts, as well so this is a intervention to enhance learning that mimics sleep in certain ways. And we know this based on brain recordings of what happens during things like yoga nidra.

And then excitingly just this last year work published also in cell reports showed that consolidation of hum

It's 8.30pm. I did probably 5 more pomodoros yesterday, working on the user interface for Pomodoro app. The workers were captivating and irresistible. I spent 5 Pomodoro's on work today and spent 8 more Pomodoro's on my site project. I'm not sure if that is the best use of my time right now. Once I start working on something interesting, especially graphs, I find it very hard to stop myself. I never was able to stop. I had to finish.

I wanted to visualize my Pomodoro data. I already have a dashboard. It would take me minimal effort to process newly generated data and upload it onto the dashboard

m going to try to change things so that I do the bare minimum and check out for the day. I don't think it's a good idea to keep pushing. I have done four Pomodoros today. Let's see if I can check by 3 p.m.

It's 3:50 p.m. now. I did six Pomodoros today. I am not going to work anymore. The job I've been babysitting since yesterday just keeps failing, and I keep trying out different techniques to make it work. I am still keeping an eye on it.

You know what? I need to badge into the office today. So I think I'll take a shower now, hop into the office, and continue journaling there. Sounds like a fun thing to do. My office is not designed for work anyways.

It's 5:15 p.m. I'm at the office now, had a quick chat with a co-worker, took care of some work, and I'm back to journaling. I was able to find a spot in the office where I won't get distracted.

Today I also learned that I have a machine that dispenses free sparkling water at the office. This floor seems much better than the other place that I used to sit previously. I don't have a desk, but this will do for journaling. I don't feel very tired anymo

I got up at 6.50am, time to do my morning routine. It's going to be a busy morning. I want to see how quickly I can get back to my desk. It's 7.01am right now.

 I am back at my desk. I did a 30 minute workout. It's now 8.20am. That checks out. I usually lose somewhere between 30 minutes to 60 minutes for other morning activities (i.e., excluding my workout time.). This is why I tend to skip my morning workouts if I get up after 7.30am. Okay, time to work.

It's 12.56pm. I published and presented the weekly report. But I ended up getting more work. I told my manager that I had

I've added some sticky notes at my bed and also at the mirror where I wake up and brush my teeth. I'm also going to set some reminders on my phone just to be on the safe side. This is going to be hard

 i ask y'all- you know, how do you get motivated? or when i ask you, like, what is motivation? what do most people say, right, so what most people will do is they'll like: look at someone who they perceive as motivated and they'll be like, oh, that person is motivated. and if i ask them, like you know, what does that mean to be motivated? it means, and then you'll get some kind of answer: like they get up and they do it every day. you know they, they get up, they. they'll use some kind of like. they'll say like, okay, they get up, they do it every day, they're dedicated, they're disciplined, they have dharma, have a goal and work towards it. right, like that's beautiful examples. like they have a goal and they actually get up and they work towards it. so it's kind of interesting because, if you think about it, what that really is is like you looking from the outside and observing the behavior right, and you say that, oh, motivation is a behavior. because if we're observing from the outside- and this is sort of how western science works- this is actually like a really interesting bias that our entire society has is that when we look for answers to questions, we look from

 configure a
second screen. You have to decide what's right for you in your budget. But
again, in addition to having a brightly lit room, to be able to focus and attend
to whatever it is you're working on, you want to have that screen positioned
high in your visual environment. 

Now you wouldn't want it on the ceiling necessarily, I know that would be pretty
cool, but you do want it above you. Now, there are a couple solutions to this
that don't involve a wall mount or stacking books or boxes. For instance, you
could be one of those people that likes to lie in bed or on the sofa and get
your screen up above you by putting pillows on your knees. I used to actually do
a lot of my writing and work in the middle of the night, I don't do this anymore
and I don't recommend it, but I used to do a lot of work from bed. Now I no
longer bring electronics for work into the bedroom. I just really try and keep
the bedroom for sleeping or whatever else. But in terms of lying down on the
couch, it is somewhat easier to get that screen up above you, you can kind of
slide underneath that screen and get typing, but there's a problem with that.
And we'll talk about this a little bit more in a moment, but it turns out that
your posture, literally the position of your body relative to gravity, also has

Here is a journal entry from the perspective of Ashoka:

Journal Entry - April 5, 2024

It's 6:45 am and my alarm just went off. Time to start my morning routine. I slowly get out of bed, being careful not to disturb Pravalli who is still sleeping soundly. I head to the bathroom and go through my usual steps - splash some water on my face, brush my teeth, and apply a bit of moisturizer. 

Next, I head to the kitchen and fill up my water bottle, making sure to drink a full glass before anything else. I then change into my workout clothes that I had laid out the night before. I do a quick 30-minute HIIT routine, pushing myself to give it my all. Finishing up, I feel energized and ready to tackle the day.

After a shower, I sit down at my desk and review my schedule. Looks like I have a few meetings this morning, so I want to get some uninterrupted work done beforehand. I set a timer for 25 minutes and dive into coding the new feature for our Pomodoro app. One Pomodoro down, I take a 5 minute break to stretch. 

Over the next couple hours, I'm able to complete 6 Pomodoros of focused, productive work. I'm feeling good about the progress I've made. As I wrap up my last meeting at 12:30 pm, I message Pravalli to see if she's free for a quick lunch. Luckily, she is, so I head out to pick up some salads from the cafe down the street.

After lunch, I return to my desk and spend another 2 Pomodoros reviewing some design mockups for our app. I'm still trying to hit my 210 Pomodoro goal for the office work this month, so I want to make the most of the afternoon. 

Around 5 pm, I call it a day on the work front. I pack up and head home, excited to spend some quality time with Pravalli. When I get home, we decide to go for a walk around the neighborhood. It's a beautiful spring evening, so we stroll hand-in-hand, chatting about our days.

After the walk, we make a simple dinner together and then settle in on the couch to watch a show. I'm feeling content and grateful for this time to unwind. As 10 pm rolls around, I start my bedtime routine - wash face, moisturize, floss, and then read a few pages of my book before turning out the light. I drift off to sleep, looking forward to another productive day tomorrow.

Thanks for asking!
