write python code for cli app that uses click library. 
It takes a subcommand called "edit-file". 
The argument for "edit-file" is a string called `filename`. 
The function should read the contents of the file and store it in the format
"""
<file1>
# filepath: <path-to-file>
Contents of the file
</file1>
"""
The subcommand should be able to take in multiple filenames and generate the above output.
Store this in a variable called context.
Then, the function should create a temporary filename (the filename should have time stamp) in the Operating system's native
temp directory (like /tmp) and open it using `os.popen("code <temp-file-name>)`. 
Then the modification time is monitored in a while loop. When the file is modified,
it should invoke the following snippet
```py
api = Claude("anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0")
result = api.invoke(prompt)
```
where prompt is the contents of the temp file.
