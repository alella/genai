Write a python function that takes in a query string, body and context window length. It matches the query string in the body and returns text a few characters before and after the query-string so that it matches the context window length. Window length is number of words to return.
example: 
  query: phone
  body: I am with my phone right now. I want to stay away.
  window_length: 5

output: "with my phone right now."

```py
def get_context(query, body, window_length):
    #todo
```

Only show the code. You don't need to provide any explanation.
